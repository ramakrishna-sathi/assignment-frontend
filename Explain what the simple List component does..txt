The list component is basically used to map the values present inside the items, which is passed as props to the list component. In list component we created two hooks 
firstly, usestate hook for storing the index value and updating it.
second, useeffect hook for resetting the value of selectedindex whenever the items has been updated.
We will be using a function called handleclick for updating the selectedindex value whenever the handle click function is called using clickhandler function.
Now we will be using a child component within the list component to do the main functinality of the webpage that is changing the colour of the item when it is clicked. It takes four arguments 
i.e, onclickhandler used to handle the javascript onclick function, index for index value, text which has to be displayed,isselected bool type for checking which index is selected by the user.

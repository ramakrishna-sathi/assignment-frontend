1. In onclick function inside the WrappedSingleList component we should create a function and pass onclickhandler function
    onClick={()=>onClickHandler(index)}
2. For usestate first we should give current state and after that we should pass the function that is used to update the state
    const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState();
3. Inside map function we should define key for each item for uniquely identifying the each item.
    key={index}
4. For isselected prop of SingleListItem we should compare the value of selectedindex and index gor identifying the item selected.
    isSelected={selectedIndex===index}
5. Inside WrappedListComponent.propTypes it should be arrayOf not array and it should be shape not shapeof, these both are syntax errors
   and also in shape validation of index is not provided its validation should also be updated in the code.
    WrappedListComponent.propTypes = {
    items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
    text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,index: PropTypes.number
    })),
    };
